# Compendium

## A neophyte's guide to the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/getting-started)

You can read the [Documentation](http://tercenya.github.io/compendium) online.

Sample code is located in each of the language folders.  All languages have a 'native' implementation (meaning they access the API without the use of a client library), but some have example implementations using popular libraries.

All sample code expects you to pass an `API_KEY` environment variable from the command line.

## Development

To build the docs, see the [README in the docs](https://github.com/tercenya/compendium/tree/master/docs) folder.

Pull requests are welcome.
