## Compendium is a neophyte's guide to the Riot Games API for League of Legends.

Although Riot provides a Getting Started page, many newcomers opine their struggles on the forums when starting out.

There's a lot you can do with the Riot API, and a bit you need to know before hand... one page just can't quite cover everything you need to know to get started.


## Compendium is a step-by-step walkthrough to get you going.


## Compendium targets the novice programmer.

Perhaps you have taken a course or two on programming?

Or perhaps you already know what you want to build, but found the official documentation a bit terse?

You want to try your hand at the Riot API challenge, but you're having trouble getting off the ground?

This is the guide for you.


If you are completely new to programming, even this guide may pose a challenge.
However, I would encourage you to try, as every program every written was once just the desire of a would-be programmer, who they themselves had to set forth and learn, just the same.
